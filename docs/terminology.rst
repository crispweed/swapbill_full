Terminology
=============

For simplicity, throughout this documentation, we may use:

* 'the client' to refer to the SwapBill reference client
* 'bitcoind' to refer to the bitcoin reference client, but also by implication other potential host blockchain reference clients (such as litecoind)
* 'swapbill' to refer to amounts of swapbill (without necessarily also specifying which host this is on)
* 'SwapBill' (capitalised) to refer to the SwapBill protocol, or to the embodiment of this protocol in the SwapBill reference client

For currency amounts we'll commonly refer to 'swapbill' and 'host coin'.
