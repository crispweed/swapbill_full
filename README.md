# Requirements

The SwapBill client is written in Python and supports Python versions 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.

The third party Python 'ecdsa' and 'requests' modules are required and must be installed.

The client uses the litecoin reference client (litecoinQT or litecoind) as a backend, and so this reference client must also be installed.

The client has been tested on Linux and Windows, but should work on any platform which supports the litecoin reference client and the
required Python dependencies.

# Setting up litecoinQT or litecoind as an RPC server

You can get the reference client from <https://litecoin.org/>.

The SwapBill client connects to the reference client with RPC calls, and so we need to ensure that this set up as an RPC server.

The reference client should then also connect to the litecoin testnet (as opposed to mainnet), and maintain a full transaction index.

To set this up, create a litecoin.conf file in the default location (if you don't already have one), and add some lines like the following:

    server=1
    testnet=1
    txindex=1
    rpcuser=litecoinrpc
    rpcpassword=somesecretpassword

(Change the password!)

The default location for this file on Linux is `~/.litecoin/litecoin.conf`,
while on Windows it looks like this is located at the path corresponding to `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\LiteCoin\litecoin.conf`,
depending on your system setup.

To start the server you can then either launch litecoinQT (the graphical client) normally, or run litecoind from the command line.
If running litecoind, the -printtoconsole option can be used to get console output about what the server is doing.

If you already ran the reference client previously, against testnet, *without the txindex option* a reindexing operation will be required,
you should get a message about this.
If running litecoinQT you should be able to just click OK to go ahead, or you can call litecoind with the -reindex option to do this explicitly.

You can test the RPC server by making RPC queries from the command line, e.g.:

    ~/git/litecoin/src $ ./litecoind getbalance
    11914.15504872

(This RPC interface is very handy for interaction with the reference client generally, and for general troubleshooting.)

# Running the client

There's no installation process for the client, currently, and instead this just runs directly
from the downloaded source tree.
(You'll need to ensure that third party dependencies are met, before running the client, or you'll get an error message telling you to do this.)

At the time of writing, the project is hosted on <https://github.com/crispweed/swapbill>, and you can get the client source code with:

```
~/git $ git clone https://github.com/crispweed/swapbill
Cloning into 'swapbill'...
remote: Counting objects: 52, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (41/41), done.
remote: Total 52 (delta 9), reused 46 (delta 3)
Unpacking objects: 100% (52/52), done.
```

and then run the client with (e.g.):

```
~/git $ cd swapbill/
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_balance
```

Or, if you don't have git, you can download the archive from <https://github.com/crispweed/swapbill/archive/master.zip>, extract to a new directory, and run from there.

If you don't have litecoind or litecoinQT running, or if you don't have the RPC interface set up correctly, you'll see something like:

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_balance
Couldn't connect for remote procedure call, will sleep for ten seconds and then try again.
Couldn't connect for remote procedure call, will sleep for ten seconds and then try again.
(...repeated indefinitely)
```

But if you start the RPC server, the client should connect and complete the command from there.

If the RPC interface is working correctly you should see something like this:

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_balance
Failed to load from cache, full index generation required (no cache file found)

Committed state updated to start of block 283286

Operation successful

total : 0
```

# Basic operation

## Testnet

For the current release the client is configured to work only with the litecoin testnet,
and only spend 'testnet litecoin' outputs, and any swapbill balances created with the client are then all 'testnet swapbill'.

As with the bitcoin testnet, litecoin testnet coins are designed to be without value, and the same then goes for testnet swapbill,
so you can try things out at this stage without spending any real litecoin.

From here on, wherever we talk about 'swapbill' or 'litecoin', for the current release this means 'testnet litecoin' and 'testnet swapbill'.

## Wallet organisation

From here on, also, we'll refer to the litecoin reference client simply as litecoind, and the SwapBill client as just 'the client'.
(The client doesn't care whether RPC requests are served by litecoind or litecoinQT, and you can use these interchangeably.)

When you run the client there are two different wallets to be aware of:
* the 'standard' litecoind wallet built in to litecoind, and
* a separate, independant wallet available and controlled only by the client.

The litecoind wallet is used mostly for 'backing' funds for dust outputs and transaction fees in the underlying blockchain,
but can also be used for special 'burn' transactions, and for litecoin payments that complete litecoin to swapbill exchanges.

The client then stores the keys for special SwapBill control outputs separately.
These are essentially outputs that control balances in the SwapBill protocol, and the client then also tracks the relevant outputs independantly of litecoind.

The client wallet can be found in the client data directory (by default a 'swapBillData' directory, created in the working directory when you start the client),
in 'wallet.txt'.
This file contains the private keys that control your swapbill balances, so don't send this file or reveal the contents to anyone,
unless you want them to be able to spend your swapbill, and make sure that the file is backed up securely!

## Creating swapbill by proof of burn

The only way to *create* swapbill is by 'proof of burn' (on the host blockchain).
Essentially, if you *destroy* some of the host currency (litecoin) in a specified way,
the swapbill protocol will credit you with a corresponding amount in swapbill.

There's some discussion of proof of burn [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn).

To create some swapbill in this way, you'll first need some litecoin to burn.

For the current testnet only release, you can get some litecoin from a faucet,
such as [here](http://testnet.litecointools.com/) or [here](http://kuttler.eu/bitcoin/ltc/faucet/),
but it also seems fairly easy at the moment to get testnet litecoin directly by mining.
For this you can simply use the ```setgenerate true``` RPC command to turn on mining in litecoind.

Once you have spendable litecoin you can go ahead and use this to create some swapbill with the client's 'burn' action.

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py burn --amount 10000000
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283276
Committed state updated to start of block 283346
In memory state updated to end of block 283366
attempting to send Burn, destination output address=myLej8rPxBF2ZE5ST2YVDpnA7Dwjh8fbRA, amount=10000000
Operation successful
transaction id : 01e436f2d26827dd9bd35b01e08a7aa4676b118284113b23ce3f0e5eac645cb6
```

The amount here is in satoshis, so this just destroyed 0.1 litecoin.
But in exchange we're credited with a corresponding amount of swapbill.

It's worth noting at this point that the SwapBill protocol includes a constraint on the minimum amount of swapbill associated with any
given SwapBill 'account', or output. This is a financial motivation for users to minimise the number of unspent and active swapbill outputs
to be tracked, and a discouragement for 'spam' outputs.
The constraint is currently set to exactly 10000000 satoshis, and so that's the minimum amount we're allowed to burn.
(If you try to burn less, the client should refuse to submit the transaction and display a suitable error message.)

By default, queries such as get_balance only report the amount actually confirmed (with at least one confirmation) by the host blockchain,
and so if we try querying this straight away, we won't see any swapbill credited for this burn:

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_balance
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283346
Committed state updated to start of block 283346
In memory state updated to end of block 283366
Operation successful
active : 0
spendable : 0
total : 0
```

But we can use the -i option to force the query to include pending transactions (from the litecoind memory pool), and then we get:

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_balance -i
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283346
Committed state updated to start of block 283346
In memory state updated to end of block 283366
in memory pool: Burn
 - 10000000 swapbill output added
Operation successful
active : 10000000
spendable : 10000000
total : 10000000
```

And then, if we wait a bit to allow the transaction to go through, we can see this as a confirmed transaction:

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_balance
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283346
Committed state updated to start of block 283349
in memory: Burn
 - 10000000 swapbill output added
In memory state updated to end of block 283369
Operation successful
active : 10000000
spendable : 10000000
total : 10000000
```

Note that it can sometimes take a while for new blocks to be mined on the litecoin testnet,
depending on whether anyone is actually mining this blockchain (!), and it can then take a while for swapbill transactions to be confirmed.

Burn transactions are necessary to create swapbill initially, and can also be used if there is no swapbill available,
but in most cases (where there is swapbill available for exchange),
you should actually prefer to obtain swapbill through the SwapBill trading mechanism,
as you'll get a better exchange rate for your host currency this way.

## Aside: committed and in memory transactions

In the above output we can see different block counts for 'committed' and 'in memory' state, and it's worth taking a moment to explain this.

What's going on here is that the client commits state to disk to avoid spending time resynchronising on each invocation,
but with this committed state lagging a fixed number of blocks (currently 20) behind the actual current block chain end.

This mechanism enables the client to handle small blockchain reorganisations robustly, without overcomplicating the client code.
If there are blockchain reorganisations of more than 20 blocks this will trigger a full resynch,
but blockchain reorganisations of less than 20 blocks can be processed naturally starting from the committed state.

For transaction reporting during synchronisation:
* Transactions that are included in the persistent state cached to disk get prefixed by 'committed'.
* Transactions that are confirmed in the blockchain but not yet cached to disk get prefixed by 'in memory'. (When you run the client again, you'll normally see these transactions repeated, unless there was a blockchain reorganisation invalidating the transaction.)
* Transactions that are not yet confirmed in the blockchain, but present in the litecoind memory pool get get prefixed with 'in memory pool'.

## Making payments

To make a payment in swapbill, we use the 'pay' action.
As with bitcoin and litecoin,
the payment recipient first needs to generate a target address for the payment,
and we can do this with the 'get_receive_address' action:

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py get_receive_address
...
Operation successful
receive_address : mox1jfYfZF5JdZrh5AiGmYB37xKza1526B
```

This is actually just a standard address for the host blockchain, but the client stores the corresponding private key in wallet.txt,
and will detect any swapbill outputs paying to this address and add the relevant amounts to your balance.

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py pay --amount 10000000 --toAddress mox1jfYfZF5JdZrh5AiGmYB37xKza1526B
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283356
Committed state updated to start of block 283358
in memory: Burn
 - 10000000 swapbill output added
In memory state updated to end of block 283378
attempting to send Pay, change output address=mvCU9EbGn9MAPgcfvZ81zkhpacopLzVpWK, destination output address=mox1jfYfZF5JdZrh5AiGmYB37xKza1526B, amount=10000000, maxBlock=283387, sourceAccount=(u'01e436f2d26827dd9bd35b01e08a7aa4676b118284113b23ce3f0e5eac645cb6', 1)
Operation successful
transaction id : 1ffb0e1fb9bea35b9a1e84ce3a82937c340070637582f2e3083e817b761ea162
```

In this case we're actually just paying ourselves.
It's also possible to manage multiple swapbill wallets independantly, by changing the client data directory,
and to use this to try out transactions between different wallet 'owners':

```
~/git/swapbill $ mkdir alice
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir alice get_receive_address
...
Operation successful
receive_address : mmdAwus4b6chWzvRtNVcL2YfxvWTeWUcq3
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py -pay --amount 10000000 --toAddress mmdAwus4b6chWzvRtNVcL2YfxvWTeWUcq3
```

And then in this case, the default wallet owner is debited the swapbill payment amount, and this is credited to 'alice'.

(Note that you need to create the new data directory before invoking the client. The client won't create this directory for you.)

## Multiple outputs and 'collect'

The SwapBill protocol associates swapbill amounts with special unspent outputs (where these outputs corresponding directly to unspent outputs in the underlying blockchain).
Your swapbill balance total at any one time is then calculated as the sum of swapbill outputs owned by your wallet.

Most of the transactions in the SwapBill protocol operate on just 'one swapbill unspent', as transaction input,
and the maximum amount that can be paid in to the transaction is then equal to the highest value swapbill output currently available.
This is what is reported by the 'active' value returned by the get_balance query.

If we submit a number of separate burn transactions, or if we receive multiple swapbill payments, this active balance will be less than our
balance total, and will limit the maximum amount we can spend in new transactions.

```
~/git/swapbill $ mkdir bob
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob burn --amount 12345678
...
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob burn --amount 11111111
...
(transaction is confirmed on host blockchain)
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob get_balance
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283393
Committed state updated to start of block 283393
in memory: Burn
 - 11111111 swapbill output added
in memory: Burn
 - 12345678 swapbill output added
In memory state updated to end of block 283413
Operation successful
active : 12345678
spendable : 23456789
total : 23456789
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob pay --amount 13000000 --toAddress mmdAwus4b6chWzvRtNVcL2YfxvWTeWUcq3
...
In memory state updated to end of block 283413
Operation failed: ('Transaction would not complete successfully against current state:', 'insufficient balance in source account (transaction ignored)')
```

So the active balance is effectively the maximum amount that can be spent at any one time.

The 'collect' transaction combines multiple outputs into a single new output, and
from the point of view of the balances shown in the client, what this does is to move all of the swapbill included in the spendable balance
into that active balance.

```
~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob collect
Loaded cached state data successfully
State update starting from block 283393

(wait a bit for the collect transaction to get confirmed)

~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob get_balance

In memory state updated to end of block 283418
Operation successful
active : 23456789
spendable : 23456789
total : 23456789

(and now we can make the payment)

~/git/swapbill $ python Client.py --dataDir bob pay --amount 13000000 --toAddress mmdAwus4b6chWzvRtNVcL2YfxvWTeWUcq3

```

## Splitting accounts

When you spend less than the amount in your active balance, in a pay transaction for example,
this has the effect of 'splitting' that balance into two separate outputs, and it's important to be aware of how the minimum balance constraint then comes into play.

The key point to be aware of is that the SwapBill protocol does not permit amounts less than the minimum balance constraint in
*either* the payment destination output, *or* the payment change output (if there is one).

So, based on the current minimum balance constraint of 10000000 satoshis, if the active account contains exactly 20000000 satoshis
then you can make a payment of:
* exactly 10000000 satoshis (which leaves both payment target and change exactly at the minimum balance), or
* exactly 20000000 satoshis (with no change output created)
but you can't make a payment of:
* less than 10000000 satoshis (result in payment destination holding less than minimum balance), or
* in between 10000000 and 20000000 satoshis (which would require a change output with less than the minimum balance)

## Trading swapbill for host currency

The swapbill protocol includes support for decentralised exchange between swapbill and the host currency, based on buy and sell
offer information posted on the block chain and protocol rules for matching these buy and sell offers.

Although more complicated than submitting a burn transaction,
this is usually the best way to obtain swapbill (as long as there is swapbill available for exchange)
because you will get more swapbill for the same amount of litecoin,
and this exchange mechanism this should be preferred to swapbill creation through burn transactions.

Three additional client actions (and associated transaction types) are provided for this exchange mechanism:
* post_ltc_buy
* post_ltc_sell
* complete_ltc_sell

Buying litecoin with swapbill is the most straightforward use case because this requires just one action.
In this case you just post a trade offer (with amount to trade and exchange rate) and the SwapBill protocol takes over with handling the trade from there.

Selling litecoin for swapbill is a bit more complicated in that an offer completion transaction needs to be submitted to complete the transaction
after trade offers have been matched.

When buying litecoin the swapbill amount being offered is moved into the trade, and will then either be paid to the litecoin seller on completion,
or refunded on trade offer expiry or if the seller fails to complete the trade.

When selling litecoin a deposit in swapbill needs to be paid.
This is currently set to 1/16 of the trade amount.
If the seller completes the trade correctly then this deposit is refunded, but if the seller fails to make a completion payment after offers have been matched
then the deposit is paid to the matched buyer.

Exchange rates are always fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0 (greater than 0.0 and less than 1.0), and specify the number of litecoins per swapbill
(so an exchange rate of 0.5 indicates that one litecoin exchanges for 2 swapbill).

A couple of other details to note with regards to trading:
* the post sell offer transactions each effectively split off a new output (for receiving payment or refunds), and are subject to the minimum balance requirements described with regards to account splitting, above
* there is also a minimum litecoin equivalent constraint applied to trade offers - currently the litecoin equivalent for each trade offer type (calculate based on swapbill amount and exchange rate) must be at least 1000000 litecoin satoshis
* trade offers may be partially matched, and litecoin sell offers can then potentially require more than completion transaction

The trading mechanism provided by SwapBill is necessarily fairly complex, and can use a lot more documentation than is included here,
but for now we'll content ourselves
with a couple of worked through examples to show how this works in practice.
